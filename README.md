# FetchAPI

## Code
```fetch(url, options)```

## Description
Fetch api makes it more convenient to send and recieve data from a server as compared to AJAX. ```fetch``` function returns a promise object that we can use to resolve and work with in synchronous way (making it much easier to write clean code).

## Notes
- For ```post``` request an extra parameter as an option can be provided while making a request
- Should chain ```catch``` for handling any errors during request or response
