## Page Visibility API

### Description
Helps you identify if the page is actually visible to the user instead of relying on blue or focus events


### Code
```document.visibilityState```

#### Events
- ```document.visibilitychange```


### Notes
- Previously ```onblur``` and ```onfocus``` was used, but they are not effective for this problem
- Also before ~~```document.visibility```~~ was used but it's deprecated now
